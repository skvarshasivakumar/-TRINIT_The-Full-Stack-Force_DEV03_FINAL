  <p>PRECISION IRRIGATION</p>
  <p>Precision irrigation uses technology such as sensors, weather data, and mapping to make informed decisions about water use in agriculture. This helps to conserve water resources and improve crop yields.</p>
  <p>MICRO IRRIGATION</p>
  <p>Micro-irrigation is a method of delivering water and nutrients directly to the roots of crops, using low-volume, low-pressure systems such as drip irrigation. This results in higher yields, lower water use, and improved soil health.</p>
  <p>AUTOMATED IRRIGATION</p>
  <p>Automated irrigation systems are computer-controlled systems that automatically adjust the amount of water applied to crops based on soil moisture levels and weather conditions. These systems can improve water efficiency, reduce runoff, and improve yields, while also reducing the time and labor required for manual irrigation.</p>
